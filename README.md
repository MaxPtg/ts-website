#### Docker Deployment

You can deploy TS-website using `Docker` and `docker-compose`. The `docker-compose.yml` file is included in the repository. Before setting up the containers, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. There is an example `.env` file in the repository. You can use it as a template.

After creating the `.env` file, you can start the containers using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

> **Note:** On step 3 (Database Details) of the installer, you need to use `db` as the database hostname.

### Other stuff

I am happy to take any programming-related requests, add additional features or modify the code to suit your needs for a small donation :) I am experienced at Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, server configurations etc.
